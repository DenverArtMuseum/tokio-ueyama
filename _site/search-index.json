They lived there for nearly three years alongside more than 10,000 other people of Japanese descent from the West Coast. (In fact, for a time, Amache was the third largest city in Colorado.) The climatic and geographic extremes of the region compounded the psychological toll of being racially segregated with no definite end in sight. The Ueyamas shared this experience with over 120,000 people across ten “relocation camps,” as they are still euphemistically referred. Theirs are stories of dislocation and loss and—just as importantly—of resilience, tenacity, and creativity in the face of prejudice.</p>\n<p>Here, the Denver Art Museum tells the story of the life and experience of Ueyama, including his time at Amache. His experience reminds us that many facets of the American West remain to be fully understood and acknowledged, including the integral role of diverse peoples of Asian descent who established homes and careers on the West Coast and greater American interior. Their stories add dimension to our evolving American art canon.</p>\n<p>I commend JR Henneman, Director of the Petrie Institute and Curator of Western American Art, for bringing this enlightening exhibition to fruition. I extend my gratitude to ShiPu Wang, whose contribution to this publication provides an invaluable analysis of work by Ueyama and other incarcerated artists. This project would not have been possible without the participation and support of Ueyama’s family and the Japanese American National Museum, to all of whom I am deeply appreciative. And, finally, thanks to the residents who support the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD).</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"cheinrich"}],"length":294,"subtitle":null,"title":"Director's Foreword","type":"essay","url":"https://denverartmuseum.github.io/tokio-ueyama/ch-foreword/"},{"content":"<figure id=\"ptl-26159\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26159\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A man in a white shirt looks directly forward, with a white full-length sculpture behind his right shoulder.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26159.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Self Portrait, 1924.

The Japanese-born artist Tokio Ueyama (pronounced <em>oo-eh-yama</em>, 1889–1954) painted the first in 1924 around age thirty-five. In it, he wears a collarless white button-up shirt open at the neck, the informality of which echoes his loosely brushed-back black hair. A nude female sculpture hovers behind his right shoulder, a testament to the figure of the human body that inspired him. A few years earlier, Ueyama had completed his academic training at the prestigious Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) and completed a tour of Spain, France, and Italy. He completed this work before his trip to Mexico during the summer of 1925, where he met artists including Diego Rivera, Jean Charlot, and probably Edward Weston. For years, Ueyama participated in exhibitions up and down the West Coast and helped organize art groups based in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. In retrospect, it is easy to read this self-portrait as one of a skilled artist looking curiously and confidently at a world of opportunity.</p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-26190\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26190\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"The a man in a white button-up shirt holds paint brushes and a palette.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26190.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Self Portrait, July 1943.

He is still dressed in a white button-up open at the neck, his thinning hair now carefully groomed. Tighter handling of paint signals careful mastery of the brush learned over years of practice as well as, possibly, the controlled environment in which this was painted: the Granada Relocation Center, best known as Amache (pronounced <em>ah-mah-chee</em>), in southeast Colorado. In this somber yet striking portrait, in which three brushes and a palette reinforce his occupation and align him with centuries of artists’ self-representation, Ueyama proclaims his profession and his personhood—no small thing given the dehumanizing experience of being forcibly relocated as an “enemy alien” during World War II.</p>\n<p><em>The Life and Art of Tokio Ueyama</em> tells the story of this cosmopolitan artist. From age eighteen in 1908 to his death at sixty-four in 1954, Ueyama called the United States his home, even though, as an Asian-born person, he was not allowed American citizenship. As a person of Japanese descent living on the West Coast during World War II, Ueyama and his wife, Suye, along with around 120,000 others, were incarcerated within “relocation centers” hastily built in some of the most remote parts of the American interior.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> For two years, eight months, and twenty-three days, Tokio and Suye lived at the Granada Relocation Center. This exhibition spans the entirety of Ueyama’s life, including his prestigious art training, cosmopolitan travels, life in California, incarceration at Amache, and his and Suye’s creation of the store Bunkado in the heart of Little Tokyo in downtown Los Angeles.</p>\n<p>This project is due to the generosity of Ueyama’s friends and family. Many Japanese Americans never recovered the belongings forcibly left behind during World War II, but the Ueyamas were more fortunate. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson—their friends, neighbors, and landlords—protected their belongings and maintained their home during their incarceration. After Tokio’s and Suye’s deaths, their extended family protected and maintained their archives and Tokio’s artwork.</p>\n<p>This project is also indebted to the work of pioneering scholar and curator Karin Higa (1966–2013), who rediscovered Ueyama and, thanks to the generosity of the artist’s family, aided the placement of his artworks at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles and helped rehabilitate his life and art through publications. Higa’s work charting Asian American artists across the twentieth century has shaped Asian American art studies, and this essay relies heavily on her foundational scholarship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I and this project are also deeply grateful to ShiPu Wang, whose essay in this volume puts Ueyama’s wartime work into conversation with that of other incarcerated people of Japanese descent. Wang’s scholarship stands as a model for rehabilitating overlooked artists’ work and lives through careful archival research and relationships with artists’ families.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> In his introduction to <em>The Other American Moderns</em>, Wang highlights the “substantial volume of creative output, superb quality of pictures, and high levels of engagement with artistic, cultural, and sociopolitical discourses” of modern Asian American artists. They are, he writes, “as fascinating as many canonical artists,” and yet remain largely unknown.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Similarly, the art and life of Tokio Ueyama reveals rich artistic and interpersonal networks, ambitious creative output, and serious, prolonged attention to aesthetics—both his own and those of the art worlds in which he worked.</p>\n<p>This essay, in conjunction with the timeline included in this publication, establishes some of the facts of Ueyama’s life. Artworks in the exhibition help illustrate the trajectory of his experiences and aesthetic development. This essay defers to English-language sources, though significant archives in Japanese exist and merit examination. This digital publication establishes a foundation that, I hope, will be useful to those pursuing the many unresolved questions and rich avenues of inquiry presented by Ueyama’s life and work.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>During World War II, “relocation centers” referred to the ten permanent camps administered by the War Relocation Authority (WRA). “Relocation” and “evacuation” are widely understood as euphemisms for what were more rightly concentration camps, “where people are imprisoned not because of any crimes they committed, but because of who they are.” “Internment camps” and “incarceration camps” have also been used to refer to these locations and are used in this essay.

The 1913 Alien Land Laws in California and Arizona prohibited Asian immigrant males from purchasing or owning land.

(And worse: “Even no ice cream.”) From Venice, he traveled to Milan for multiple days, noting its modernity and wide, clean streets, then on to Genoa, Nice, Marseille, and finally Paris. There, he seemed to have many American acquaintances. He noted wounded men with medals employed as guards and that paper was scarce—legacies of the First World War.

After his return to Los Angeles in 1922, aged thirty-two, he quickly became involved with an art community in Little Tokyo, the area of downtown Los Angeles around East First Street populated by people of Japanese descent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Over the next two decades, Ueyama exhibited regularly up and down the West Coast and, from January 1927 to August 1941, worked at the Bunrindo bookstore located at 303 East First Street.</p>\n<p>Soon after his return to Los Angeles, Ueyama cofounded—along with artists Hojin Miyoshi and Sekishun Masuzo Uyeno and poet T. B. Okamura—the art association Shaku-do-sha. Dedicated to “the study and furtherance of all forms of modern art,” the Shaku-do-sha organized exhibitions in Little Tokyo.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Some of these featured work by Japanese artists—such as the first group exhibition held in 1923 at the Japanese Union Church, to which Ueyama contributed four paintings—as well as non-Japanese artists, including the photographer Edward Weston.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> By 1927, the author Ione Rayburn described the Shaku-do-sha as a “vital and flourishing colony.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>In 1922, Ueyama exhibited three paintings at the second exhibition of the East West Art Society at the San Francisco Museum of Art at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> He also launched into regular exhibitions in California, including the annual series Painters and Sculptors of Southern California, organized by the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science, and Art (now the Los Angeles County Museum of Art).

He included his 1924 <em>Self-Portrait</em> (no. 25) as well as the 1920 watercolor <em>The Castle in Naples</em> (no. 13). While difficult to determine without visual evidence, it is likely that he also included his 1924 <em>Still Life</em> (no. 10 or no. 19) and a currently untitled 1924 landscape of an alpine California landscape (possibly <em>In the High Sierras</em>, no. 23). This selection of work provides a snapshot of the subjects to which Ueyama would remain faithful for the rest of his career: the human body, portraiture, still life, and landscape.</p>\n<p>In November 1924, Ueyama sent an exhibition of twenty-five works to the gallery at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where his friend and PAFA classmate Nowland B. Zane (1885–1945), a professor there, had probably invited him to exhibit.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> During this exhibition, reviewers attempted to reconcile what one called Ueyama’s “double heritage of oriental blood and occidental training.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Another pointed to the “decorative” nature of Japanese influences and the “realistic” influences of western academies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> Margaret Skavlan interpreted Ueyama as “an art hybrid, laboring between his Japanese decorative sense and a training, here and abroad, toward realism.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> Gordon Chang has pointed out that art by people of Asian descent in the US “was constantly subjected to the trope of being a bridge between ‘Eastern’ and ‘Western’ art.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> Oregon reviewers seem to have pushed particularly hard to build this bridge, especially given that Ueyama’s paintings do not conform to what Wang has identified as “stereotypical notions of ‘Asian imagery,’ such as landscape or nature paintings done with brush and ink.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>In contrast, Los Angeles critics were more likely to point to the thorough westernization of Ueyama’s practice. Los Angeles–based art critic Antony Anderson called Ueyama’s painting <em>The Fur Coat</em> (unlocated) “a portrait of much distinction in handling, not in the least Oriental in feeling or treatment.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> Similarly, an unknown reviewer remarked of <em>Portrait of Miss B</em> (unlocated) that “Ueyama is a thoroughly Americanized Japanese. His composition has the occidental balance, his whole technical method is absolutely American.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> These reviews from Oregon and Los Angeles signal that Ueyama’s work challenged ingrained expectations about Japanese, American, and Japanese American art. As Chang has written, Asian American identities are fluid, multiple, shifting, and unstable.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> Acknowledging this reality helps blur the unproductive East/West lens through which Ueyama’s work was viewed during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>\n<p>In 1925, Ueyama made a second major international trip, this time to Mexico for the summer. In Mexico City, he listened to a lecture by Diego Rivera at the Association of Christian Women and spent time with the muralist, even keeping up a correspondence after his return to the US.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> In an interview for <em>Revista de Revistas</em>, Ueyama says he spent time with Rivera in his studio and admired his work, especially the mural in the Chapingo chapel.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> In Mexico, Ueyama probably met Edward Weston (which may have created the connection for Weston’s Shaku-do-sha exhibitions) and Jean Charlot, who wrote his address in Ueyama’s notebook.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> Ueyama traveled to Cuernavaca and Taxco, where he painted the Church of Santa Prisca from multiple perspectives (fig. 4).</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-26166\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26166\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A predominantly white church rises above a green landscape against a mountainous backdrop.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26166.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Untitled (Taxco, Mexico), 1925.

When his <em>Monterey</em> was on display in 1929, the artist and critic Arthur Millier described it as “flooded with clear light which creates a fine pattern of light and shadow on headlands, houses, and blue water.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>In February 1936, Ueyama held a significant solo exhibition of sixty-one works at the Miyako Hotel in Little Tokyo. Spanning more than a decade of output, works included studies, watercolors, and finished oils representing diverse locations in Mexico, California, and Oregon. His repertoire remained the same: still life; figure paintings, including <em>The Nude</em> (no. 6, illustrated on cover); portraits, including that of Suye and his own self-portrait; landscapes, including a striking representation of California’s Red Rock Canyon; and Mexican subjects, including <em>At Cuernavaca</em> and the church in Taxco.

Wartime hysteria, compounded by preexisting “racial discrimination, economic greed, and . . . unfounded fear,” ultimately led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order No. 9066, signed on February 19, 1942, which “authorized federal troops to exclude anyone from any location as deemed necessary for national security.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> While not explicitly stated, the order was aimed at people of Japanese descent, immigrants and citizens alike, living in western states. Soon, they would be forced from their homes. Most Japanese complied with imposed restrictions, which included curfews, travel restrictions, and frozen bank accounts, and ultimately with forced relocation, hoping that in a time of intense patriotism such submission would signal their loyalty.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>On March 18, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9102 establishing the War Relocation Authority (WRA) to formulate a program for Japanese removal. Soon, evacuation notices appeared in public spaces, and Japanese community members began moving into “reception centers,” or temporary detention centers where they would be held until removed to facilities further inland. They took only what they could carry.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Ueyamas were first detained at the Santa Anita Assembly Center, a racetrack converted into a holding center that, at its peak, held 19,000 people.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> At Santa Anita, barbed wire capped eight-foot fences around the perimeter, with search lights and armed guards placed at regular intervals. Tokio Ueyama’s painting <em>The Evacuee</em> shows Suye inside one of the wood and tar paper barracks. Other evacuees lived in converted horse stalls. Hot, fly-ridden mess halls served thousands at a time. Privacy was nearly nonexistent. In the cramped barracks, many walls did not extend all the way to the ceiling. Toilet facilities were open rooms with boards with holes about a foot apart, like massive communal outhouses. Showers, too, were communal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"ptl-26150\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26150\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A woman sews in a wooden chair in a room next to an open door.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26150.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, The Evacuee, 1942.

The camp consisted of twenty-nine blocks of barracks, and apartments within measured between sixteen-by-twenty feet and twenty-four-by-twenty feet (fig. 5). Each apartment included cots, one light bulb, and a pad or blanket.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> Those incarcerated had to source or create all other necessities.

In addition to agricultural jobs, people also worked in the Amache Silk Screen Shop, the mess halls, the hospital, the newspaper the <em>Granada Pioneer</em>, the co-op store, and the local schools.

It did not, however, stop him from painting. As part of the adult education program, he supervised and taught art classes three times a day, three days a week, with Koichi Nomiyama (1900–1984).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> In a later interview, he stated that he “taught a painting class of 150 adults at Amache . . . Many people who had always wanted to try their hand at painting found their first opportunity there.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>The artworks Ueyama and his students produced demonstrate that they worked from what they had at hand, such as household items (fig. 7). One of his charcoal still lifes features a bowl, vase, tea kettle, and citrus fruits, while another presents a platter of fish. In a still life painted in February 1943, Ueyama depicts a large squash, dried corn cobs, and an oil lamp on a table. A large sombrero hangs on the wall flanked by a blue and red plaid fabric. The vegetables refer to the many crops that those at Amache helped grow, both as part of the camp’s work program as well as in their own victory gardens.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> As Wang writes in his essay in this publication and elsewhere, the sombrero may also allude to Ueyama’s time in Mexico.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> In another oil from August 1943, Ueyama paints large sunflowers in bloom, with a grasshopper perched on a leaf just above his signature. Rather than pulled around a stretcher or strainer, this oil on canvas is cropped to the image and taped onto a thick compressed board, a technique that Ueyama replicates in other works. It is possible the board is the same material as had been used to build the Amache barracks.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> He made use of what was available and may have approached his challenging situation with <em>shikata ga nai</em>, or “it can’t be helped,” and by practicing <em>gaman</em>, or “accepting what is with patience and dignity.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"exrr-2024-17\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--3\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-17\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Several adults paint at easels in this black-and-white photograph.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\exrr-2024-17.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-17\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tom Parker, photographer for the War Relocation Authority, In an adult still life art class, Tokio Ueyama gives a few pointers to one of the students, 1942.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">Bancroft Library at the University of California, WRA no.

One oil captures the dry plains landscape with barracks in the background, while another features a closer look at life in the camp, complete with basketball hoop made from found materials, transplanted trees, laundry on a line, and figures in jeans and T-shirts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> The organic arcs of dried cornstalks in the foreground, probably part of a victory garden, echo the rounded billow of clouds above. One of Ueyama’s pastels shows dark clouds above barracks, fence, and water tower (which still stands today), while a brighter composition shows people working in a field, the Amache barracks in the background. In other landscapes, Ueyama depicts scenes outside the camp. Two charcoal drawings feature wintertime trees and fences, while two others present Granada houses and outbuildings. One oil shows an old, high-withered horse standing in the sun by a faded red barn and part of an antique hitch wagon. Other barns bathed in warm light show up in two pastels. A winter landscape, also taped to fiber board, presents a scene of red willows glowing against snow. Ueyama’s landscapes—which seem to celebrate the land, sky, and rural architecture of Granada—rarely allude to the harsh conditions of his forced confinement. In his essay for this publication, Wang provides a deeper dive into some of Ueyama’s wartime work and places it in the context of artworks by other Japanese people incarcerated during the war.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-26151\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--4\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26151\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A house and barn overlook a pond, with rows of barracks in the background in this mostly brown landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26151.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Untitled (barracks with pond), 1944.

Similarly, residents of the greater region visited Amache for work, shopping, and social and cultural opportunities. At this time, Amache was by far the largest “city” in the region, with its own schools, sports leagues, Boy Scout troop, theatrical and musical performances, and art exhibitions, including the 1943 Arts and Crafts Festival in which Ueyama exhibited <em>The Evacuee</em>.

Such a task would have helped signal the passage of time in a context that must have felt like purgatory. Earlier, when traveling in Europe, Ueyama left a reflective note in his journal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“the stone on the road side<br>\nbegins its history of existence<br>\nonly when it is kicked or turned.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over twenty years later, when polishing these stones, Ueyama provides each a history of existence. The stones beg to be held, turned over, and engaged with. In a quiet way, they signal agency (in the choice of stone and in polishing it) and relationality (by unlocking the inner beauty of each stone and, possibly, through a network of people who may have helped source them). They are a reminder that existence is marked through interaction with others and that nurturing beauty plays a central role in creating and sustaining such interactions.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Robert Harvey, <em>Amache: The Story of Japanese Internment in Colorado during World War II</em> (Scottsdale, AZ: Hawes &amp; Jenkins, 2023), 30. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Around 9,000 people voluntarily relocated inland.

The American West has long been a place of inspiration and artistic production (well before the arrival of any Europeans), though its borders, boundaries, and definitions continue to shift.</p>\n<p>Over the past twenty-plus years, the leaders and staff of the Petrie Institute have produced scholarship and exhibitions on western American art that meaningfully reintegrate it into American and global art histories. Simultaneously, they have grown the collection into one of the most important in the country. The Petrie Institute continues to expand American art histories, seeking underappreciated or overlooked artists and unexpected stories. The life and work of Japanese American artist Tokio Ueyama fits well within the mission of the Institute while revealing that there are many stories yet to be told, including those that touch upon some of the country’s most challenging histories.</p>\n<p>Working on this project has been a particularly moving and revelatory experience, one that has consistently reminded me of my own blind spots in American history. I am humbled and honored to lead this meaningful project, especially given the richness of the archives and artworks dutifully maintained by Ueyama’s extended family. In particular, I am grateful to Grace Keiko and Mark Nozaki, Irene Tsukada Simonian, Dane Ishibashi, Susie Ishibashi, Clem and Angie Yang, and David Hirai. Thank you for trusting the Denver Art Museum, and me, with your uncle’s important story and for so graciously hosting me in your homes and businesses.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, this project is due to ShiPu Wang, Professor and Coats Family Endowed Chair in the Arts at the University of California, Merced. Thank you, ShiPu, for your generosity and collegiality, and for making all the necessary introductions.</p>\n<p>At the DAM, I am grateful to Meg Selig, curatorial assistant; Lauren Thompson, senior interpretive specialist; Jesse Laird Ortega, assistant project manager; Caitlin Rumery, associate registrar for traveling exhibitions; Pam Skiles, senior paintings conservator; Valerie Hellstein, managing editor; Leslie Murrell, editor; and Matt Popke, developer.</p>\n<p>My appreciation goes to Darcy Christ, for developing this digital publication.</p>\n<p>Thank you to Memphis Despain and Noriko Okada for translation assistance.</p>\n<p>I extend deep gratitude to Kristen Hayashi at the Japanese American National Museum for accommodating our loan requests and being a crucial resource.</p>\n<p>Many thanks to the people who have worked to tell the story of Amache and preserve its historic site, especially to Bonnie Clark for sharing her expertise and insight and to project consultants Dana Shew, Mitch Homma, and Lily Havey, who helped us better understand how to sensitively and responsibly present the history of Amache to our audiences.</p>\n<p>Finally, for fielding a variety of research questions, my thanks to:</p>\n<p>Pauline Wolstencroft, Senior Librarian, Balch Art Research Library and Archives, Los Angeles County Museum of Art</p>\n<p>Michael Brown, Curator of European Art, San Diego Museum of Art, and Karen Hinchcliffe, Curatorial Administrator</p>\n<p>Jeff Gunderson, Archivist/Librarian of the SFAI Legacy Foundation + Archives</p>\n<p>Claude B.

I admittedly did not regard them as something particularly special. Sure, seeing multiple versions of the same rock formations across a watercolor sketchbook, a small oil, and a larger finished oil painting did generate a mental note: this must be a meaningful place for the artist. I later learned a few factors that made this series of landscapes stand out even more from the hundreds of artworks I have seen by this artist: the smaller oil, dated February 1944, was created at the Amache incarceration camp where Ueyama was imprisoned during World War II, and the scenery features the coast of Katsuura (勝浦), a part of Nachikatsuura (那智勝浦) in the southeast part of Wakayama Prefecture (和歌山県) in Japan, the same prefecture where Ueyama was born and raised.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-26193\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--3\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26193\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"This open notebook has a painting of a rock outcropping and blue water on the right page.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26193.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, (Sketchbook from Japan), 1937.

Ueyama likely made the watercolor sketch in 1936–37, during his only return to his hometown in Wakayama since emigrating to the United States in 1908. He worked on at least one smaller oil sketch (DIMS) probably in preparation for the much larger painting (38 by 43 1/2 inches). We know he began working on this larger painting on February 4, 1940, thanks to the short entries of his daily activities that he wrote in multiple daybooks over many years; the last mention of Katsuura was on February 26, 1940.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Two final Katsuura landscapes, one in oil and one in charcoal, were created when Ueyama was incarcerated in Amache from 1942 to 1945.</p>\n<p>Ueyama did not leave any explanations for why he decided to create a 1944 version of the Katsuura coast; his extant diary entries end in 1941. But it would be reasonable to consider Ueyama’s painterly “revisit” to his hometown to be motivated by homesickness or nostalgia, especially when his physical freedom and any possibility of seeing Japan again were taken away without a foreseeable end. Recalling and re-creating the open and lush seaside with his brush when he was confined to Amache in the arid and isolating High Plains of Colorado provided some creative alternatives to, and perhaps relief from, depicting a desolate environment with barracks, dust, and storms (fig. 1). And the Katsuura landscape may have served as a kind of demonstration and visual stimulus to the art classes that Ueyama taught at the camp, as those instructions usually centered around portraiture, still life, found objects, and local scenes.</p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2024-21\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-21\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Clouds drop rain over rows of long, low buildings in this black-and-white drawing.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\exrr-2024-21.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-21\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Storm, 1943.

Many of his other camp paintings appear to be straightforward depictions of people, things, and scenes, but they do allow for deeper readings as well, especially in relation to his prewar imagery. For instance, his <em>Self-Portrait</em> of February 1943 is a dignified self-representation of a serious artist, as the depicted accoutrements suggest. The meticulous modeling of his fleshy face, with touches of sheen and blotches of flush, complements a contemplative and determined gaze. The simplicity of the background is a contrast to that in his 1924 self-portrait, where a nude statue fills the space—a signifier of his artistic training in the European tradition at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. The younger Ueyama is rendered in looser brushwork with great vitality; the glistening eyes, equally piercing as those in the 1943 self-portrait, project intensity and perhaps an aspiring artist’s optimistic outlook toward his burgeoning career. The Amache self-portrait, more subdued and somber in tone, thus serves as a poignant reminder of the passage of time (with nearly twenty years between the two) and drastically changed circumstances. Similarly, Ueyama’s untitled still life, painted in February 1943, offers a view of seemingly ordinary objects. The inclusion of an eye-catching sombrero adds texture and visual interest to the composition, but it also evokes Ueyama’s Mexican sojourn of 1925, a bygone era when he was free to roam the world—see JR Henneman’s essay and timeline in this publication.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-26190\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26190\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"The a man in a white button-up shirt holds paint brushes and a palette.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26190.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Self Portrait, July 1943.

The process of painting the same scene, either from memory or an old sketch, would have required him to recall details and sensations of standing at that far-flung corner of his home prefecture as crashing waves splash against jutting rocks. Re-creating Katsuura visually became an exercise in nostalgia as well as escape, a momentary respite from the dusty desolation surrounding him at Amache. Yet, this recollection is a wistful simulation of a place to which he may never be able to return, at least as it must have seemed at that moment of being confined to inland Colorado. Conversely, the landscape can be regarded as an existential affirmation as well: that he was still alive and able to paint—that even though he may have lost his freedom and belongings, he still had his artistic skills and the memories that made up who he continued to be.</p>\n<p>Ueyama’s 1944 Katsuura canvas brings up a rich array of critical considerations regarding landscape paintings created by Japanese Americans under wartime incarceration. Could <em>Katsuura</em> be considered a “camp painting,” even though its depiction is of a place in Japan that the artist re-created from memory? If so, it seems to expand our existing definitions of “camp art,” which have tended to emphasize or even valorize visible signifiers of displacement and confinement, as well as documentation and illustration of wartime trauma. Could we instead untether “camp imagery” from identifiable subject matter of incarceration and regard it as a broader and varied kind of visualization of experiential and internal processing, of existential negotiation and affirmation? That is: the act of artistically <em>re</em>-presenting one’s physical and subjective experiences, when one’s very existence is under threat, functioned as a vital means of making sense of the existential crises one’s going through. Ueyama and other incarcerated artists leveraged their creative tools to confront distressing situations, to maintain control, order, and normalcy (to the extent possible under imprisonment), and to temporarily “escape” from harsh realities. Camp landscapes offer revealing insights into incarcerated artists’ internal grappling with geographical, temporal, geopolitical, emotional, and existential conflicts and dissonances. Beyond being subjective visualizations, such paintings also serve as important accounts that collectively contribute to the composition of a chapter of American history with which we continue to reckon.</p>\n<p>Taking a broader view, we see that many of the diverse landscape paintings produced by incarcerated artists of Japanese descent are more than documentary in nature. While many do focus on the “now,” depicting that which surrounded and confined them as they lived through the unjust imprisonment one day—and one painting—at a time, their imagery functioned as a kind of “intervention” as the artists leveraged creative tools to represent, aestheticize, and transform their environment and experience. For example, Chiura Obata, Ueyama’s contemporary colleague and a San Francisco Bay Area artist renowned for his paintings of Yosemite and Sierra Nevada, produced numerous landscapes during his wartime confinement at the San Bruno Assembly Center in California and the Central Utah Relocation Center (Topaz).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Many of his images captured the drastic fluctuations of weather and the heat, dust, and storms blanketing Topaz. But as I have analyzed elsewhere, Obata adopted an approach of picturing the camp from an elevated perspective, as if the artist were hovering above the ground or on a distant hill (even at nighttime). It is an imaginary position that implies a kind of psychological distancing—detachment as coping mechanism, perhaps—while the “all-seeing” view takes on a broader perspective that makes sense of the harsh reality and, in turn, affirms one’s place in it. Such a pictorial strategy produced images that are aesthetically pleasing while adding poignancy and ambivalence, as seen in <em>Moonlight Over Topaz, Utah</em> (1942, fig. 2), for example—a work that was commissioned by the Japanese American Citizens League and presented to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1943, who displayed the painting in her New York City apartment until her death.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2024-22\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-22\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Blue mountain peaks in the background are partly obscured by fog or haze.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\exrr-2024-22.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-22\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">2</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Chiura Obata, Moonlight Over Topaz, Utah, 1942.

In <em>Clouds Over Water Tower</em> (fig. 3) and <em>Landscape Near Topaz</em> (fig. 4), for instance, Obata applied his expert handling of <em>sumi-e</em> (Japanese ink and brush painting) to capture natural elements in fluid, energetic lines. Beyond the imposing water tower is a snow-capped mountain range that looks like roiling waves; some dark clouds dance above, allowing glimpses of a bright, blue sky. The monochromatic <em>Landscape Near Topaz</em>, likely painted on one of the excursions that the incarcerated people were allowed to take later during wartime, presents a mountain that seems to be breathing and expanding, as if it were about to devour or envelop the incoming traveler. The upward brushstrokes that render the trees and slopes guide the viewer’s attention skyward, beyond the forbidding mountain that blocks the view of and, by implication, access to a free world on the other side. While this ink landscape is reminiscent of Obata’s prewar imagery of “Great Nature” (<em>Daishizen</em>, in his native Japanese), the economy of his single-color brushwork adds to the visual representation of the bleak circumstances that surrounded the artist and his fellow camp prisoners.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"2022-119\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#2022-119\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A tall watertower is set against a cloudy sky.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\2022_119.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#2022-119\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">3</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Chiura Obata, Clouds Over Water Tower, January 29, 1943.

He carefully (re)arranged structures, trees, bushes, and clouds, likely taking creative licenses on the actual scenes he observed to compose the fore-, middle, and background expected in a classic landscape painting. In the 1944 <em>Untitled (Barracks with Pond)</em>, for instance, the pond and a lone shed serve as countervailing elements that anchor the flat land with rows of barracks in the distance. In <em>Untitled (Amache Landscape with Barrack and Tower)</em>, dated April 1944, the two structures stand in the lower center of the composition, allowing Ueyama to render the grey clouds in crosshatching strokes that suggest morphing fluffiness gliding through an expansive sky. These, along with a few more Amache paintings in this exhibition, make up a group of imagery that could have been received as an artist’s celebration of the idyllic, rural beauty of the American Southwest. They are, but by an incarcerated artist whose freedom this country ripped away, adding dimensions of irony, poignancy, and historical gravitas.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"ptl-26151\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#ptl-26151\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A house and barn overlook a pond, with rows of barracks in the background in this mostly brown landscape.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\ptl-26151.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Tokio Ueyama, Untitled (barracks with pond), 1944.

Hisako Hibi, an artist also incarcerated at Topaz and the wife of Obata’s good friend Matsusaburo George Hibi, used oil paint to create spectacular views of the sun’s radiant display. Her <em>Eastern Sky 7:50 A.M.</em> of February 25, 1945 (fig. 5), and <em>Western Sky</em>, of Topaz, Utah, in July 1945 (fig. 6), are expressionistic, almost abstract depictions of breathtaking views that the artist took care to capture. The contrasting colors of crimson against charcoal and yellow against persimmon, as well as free-flowing lines and organic forms in the sky versus heavier, dark lines on the ground, all contribute to an immersive, sensorially rich viewing experience. Hibi minimizes the people, barracks, and even mountain, relegating them to the lower part of the composition and instead highlighting the vastness of the open sky and the infinitesimal human existence.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"exrr-2024-23\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-23\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A dark mountain and buildings are set against a bright orange sky.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\exrr-2024-23.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-23\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">5</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Hisako Hibi, Eastern Sky, 7:50 AM, February 25, 1945.

In <em>Floating Clouds</em> (April 1944), for instance, she chose to let her eyes and imagination soar and play with the clouds as she depicted cotton candy–like fluffiness frolicking in the air above the barracks (fig. 7).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> The scene has a sense of serenity that belies the reality of the painter living in an inhospitable, challenging place while raising two young children and teaching and helping at the art school that her husband and Obata established at Topaz. Her own commentary on the canvas’s back is revealing: “Topaz sky / It was an interesting cloudy day / Floating clouds / フワリ フワリ フワリ [fuwari, fuwari, fuwari] / Free, free, freeforme [sic] in the spacious sky / I want to be free, as free as that cloud I see up above Topaz.” <em>Fuwari</em> is a kind of onomatopoeia, meaning “flutter, fluffy, floating.” Hibi’s words thus add a descriptive, sonic dimension to her visual representation of what she saw as well as her thoughts and emotions: her desire to be free from the physical confinement and the grave injustice that she (and fellow Japanese Americans) experienced. The proclamation “I want to be free” was likely added to the painting’s verso later in her life (she revisited and wrote on the back of many paintings). But it serves as both an honest retrospection on the artist’s state of mind under incarceration and a statement of hope and self-motivation that led her on a decades-long journey, through wartime and postwar challenges, to pursue her own voice and freedom in both her art and life.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"exrr-2024-26\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-26\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Billowing clouds roll over rooftops.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\fpo\\exrr-2024-26.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#exrr-2024-26\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Hisako Hibi, Floating Clouds, 1944.

Such wartime works, as seen in <em>The Life and Art of Tokio Ueyama</em>, point to the flourishing prewar <em>and</em> postwar careers that some of these artists had in diverse communities across the US. It affirms the vital work of recuperating the extensive artistic output of the pre-WWII generations of American artists of Japanese descent, shifting the almost-exclusive spotlight on Japanese American incarceration toward examining the artists’ full oeuvres and allowing for a more inclusive and accurate history of twentieth-century American art.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I must express my gratitude for the generosity of the Ueyama estate—Grace Keiko Nozaki and Irene Tsukada-Simonian, the artist’s nieces, in particular—for allowing me access to the artworks and archives in their private collections since 2015.
