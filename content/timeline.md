[^38]: Millier describes *Monterey* as “flooded with clear light which creates a fine pattern of light and shadow on headlands, houses, and blue water.” He continues: “His portrait of a young Japanese woman in black hat and coat holds one’s interest by its poise, feeling for textures and character.” Millier concludes by writing, “He is an accomplished and painstaking artist.” See Arthur Millier, “City’s Japanese Show Art,” *Los Angeles Times*, December 29, 1929.

[^41]: To date, this author has not sourced the catalog for this exhibition. Based on the review by *LA Times* art critic Antony Anderson, Ueyama had on display “an imposing and exceedingly skillful portrait of a young Japanese woman.” This might be his large portrait of Suye in a kimono painted in 1929 and now at the Japanese American National Museum. Anderson continues that Ueyama’s “strong modeling and understanding breadth of style show him to be one of our finest portrait painters, indeed, quite among the good portraitists of the country.” See clipping in red scrapbook, Bunkado collection, 15.
