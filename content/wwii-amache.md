Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, drew the United States into World War II. Wartime hysteria, compounded by preexisting “racial discrimination, economic greed, and . . . unfounded fear,” ultimately led to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order No. 9066, signed on February 19, 1942, which “authorized federal troops to exclude anyone from any location as deemed necessary for national security.”[^1] While not explicitly stated, the order was aimed at people of Japanese descent, immigrants and citizens alike, living in western states. Soon, they would be forced from their homes. Most complied with imposed restrictions, which included curfews, travel restrictions, and frozen bank accounts, and ultimately with forced relocation, hoping that in a time of intense patriotism such submission would signal their loyalty.[^2]

On March 18, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9102 establishing the War Relocation Authority (WRA) to formulate a program for Japanese American removal. Soon, evacuation notices appeared in public spaces, and community members began moving into “reception centers,” or temporary detention centers, where they would be held until removed to facilities further inland. They took only what they could carry.[^3]

The Ueyamas were first detained at the Santa Anita Assembly Center, a racetrack converted into a holding center that, at its peak, held 19,000 people.[^4] At Santa Anita, barbed wire capped eight-foot fences around the perimeter, with search lights and armed guards placed at regular intervals. Tokio Ueyama’s painting *The Evacuee* (cat. 19, illustrated nearby) shows Suye inside one of the wood and tar paper barracks. Other evacuees lived in converted horse stalls. Hot, fly-ridden mess halls served thousands at a time. Privacy was nearly nonexistent. In the cramped barracks, many walls did not extend all the way to the ceiling. Toilet facilities were open rooms with boards with holes about a foot apart, like massive communal outhouses. Showers, too, were communal.[^5]

In September, the Ueyamas were put on a train to Amache, an experience remembered by other evacuees as hot, long, monotonous, and uncomfortable.[^6] Upon arriving, the camp was not yet finished, much of the water was non-potable, and electricity was frequently unavailable.[^7] Once complete, the entire site encompassed more than 10,000 acres, the majority of which was devoted to agricultural production. The camp consisted of twenty-nine blocks of barracks, and apartments within measured between sixteen-by-twenty feet and twenty-four-by-twenty feet (fig. 1). Each apartment included cots, one light bulb, and a pad or blanket.[^8] Those incarcerated had to source or create all other necessities. Many fashioned beautiful gardens and planted trees to enhance their bleak living conditions.[^9] Each block included a recreation hall, mess hall, and lavatory. In addition to agricultural jobs, people also worked in the Amache Silk Screen Shop, the mess halls, the hospital, the newspaper the *Granada Pioneer*, the co-op store, and the local schools. Sports, dances, religious services, movies, clubs, and extracurricular classes, among other activities, helped alleviate boredom.[^10] Those forced to live at Amache worked to create a sense of normalcy and community even while battered by extreme temperatures and wind, surrounded by barbed wire fences, and shadowed by eight armed towers (fig. 2).

Ueyama’s relocation to Amache ruptured his previously rigorous exhibition schedule and the dynamic artistic community he and other Japanese American creatives had forged in Little Tokyo. It did not, however, stop him from painting. As part of the adult education program, he supervised and taught art classes three times a day, three days a week, with Koichi Nomiyama (1900–1984) and other instructors in the 7E block recreation hall.[^11] In a later interview, he stated that he “taught a painting class of 150 adults at Amache . . . Many people who had always wanted to try their hand at painting found their first opportunity there.”[^12]

The artworks Ueyama and his students produced demonstrate that they worked from what they had at hand, such as household items (fig. 3). One of his charcoal <span id="ptl-26182" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26182" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="Three vessels, including a kettle, are arranged with with two pieces of fruit on a tabletop draped with a cloth in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26182.jpg">still lifes</a></span> features a bowl, vase, tea kettle, and citrus fruits, while <span id="ptl-26183" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26183" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A plate of three fishes sits on a tabletop draped with a dark cloth in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26183.jpg">another</a></span> presents a platter of fish. In a <span id="ptl-26194" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26194" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A white sculpture of a head looking to the left is set against a mottled blue background." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26194.jpg">still life painted in February 1943</a></span>, Ueyama depicts a large squash, dried corn cobs, and an oil lamp on a table. A large sombrero hangs on the wall flanked by a blue and red plaid fabric. The vegetables refer to the many crops that those at Amache helped grow, both as part of the camp’s work program as well as in their own victory gardens.[^13] As ShiPu Wang writes in [his essay in this publication](/spw-essay) and elsewhere, the sombrero may also allude to Ueyama’s time in Mexico.[^14] In another oil from August 1943, Ueyama painted large sunflowers in bloom, with a grasshopper perched on a leaf just above his signature (cat. 27, illustrated below). Rather than pulled around a stretcher or strainer, this oil on canvas is cropped to the image and taped onto a thick compressed board, a technique that Ueyama replicated in other works. It is possible the board is the same material as had been used to build the Amache barracks.[^15] He made use of what was available and may have approached his challenging situation with *shikata ga nai*, or “it can’t be helped,” and by practicing *gaman*, or “accepting what is with patience and dignity.”[^16]

Portraits created by Ueyama and his students, such as charcoal portraits of a <span id="ptl-26185" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26185" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A woman with a button-up shirt and ribbon in her curled hair faces left in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26185.jpg">girl</a></span> and of a <span id="ptl-26186" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26186" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A man with glasses and white hair wears a black bowtie and suspenders in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26186.jpg">man with glasses</a></span>, show that classmates and community members took turns posing.[^17] His <span id="ptl-26154" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26154" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A man with glasses holds a stringed instrument that extends above his shoulder in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26154.jpg">portrait of Tomoye Sawa</a></span> (known professionally as Gakuhajo) shows the musician holding a *biwa*, or short-necked lute. In a vibrant oil portrait, Ueyama painted a woman wearing a plaid top and red lipstick (cat. 25, illustrated nearby). He sketched the <span id="ptl-26184" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26184" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A man with a broad military hat and a tie under his coat faces right in this black-and-white drawing." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26184.jpg">portrait of a stern soldier</a></span> on February 12, 1943, shortly after President Roosevelt activated the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated Japanese American unit that would ultimately join the segregated 100th Infantry Battalion formed in 1942. Thirty-one members of Amache would be killed at war.[^18]

Landscapes populate Ueyama’s Amache oeuvre. <span id="ptl-26151" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26151" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A house and barn overlook a pond, with rows of barracks in the background in this mostly brown landscape." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26151.jpg">One oil</a></span> captures the dry plains landscape with barracks in the background, while another features a closer look at life in the camp, complete with basketball hoop made from found materials, transplanted trees, laundry on a line, and figures in jeans and T-shirts (cat. 29, illustrated nearby).[^19] The organic arcs of dried cornstalks in the foreground, probably part of a victory garden, echo the rounded billow of clouds above. <span id="ptl-26176" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26176" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="A wooden tower stands tall next to a brown building against a dark and stormy sky." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26176.jpg">One of Ueyama’s pastels</a></span> shows dark clouds above barracks, fence, and water tower (which still stands today), while <span id="ptl-26175" class="q-figure q-figure--image inline"><a class="q-figure__modal-link" href="#ptl-26175" data-outputs-include="html"><img alt="Small figures work a field of crops bounded by green shrubs in the foreground, while the background features a row of trees against a blue sky with billowing white clouds." class="q-figure__image" src="/tokio-ueyama/_assets/images/figures/fpo/ptl-26175.jpg">a brighter composition</a></span> shows people working in a field, the Amache barracks in the background.

Ueyama’s landscapes—which seem to celebrate the land, sky, and rural architecture of Granada—rarely allude to the harsh conditions of his forced confinement. In his essay for this publication, Wang provides a deeper dive into some of Ueyama’s wartime work and places it in the context of artworks by other Japanese Americans incarcerated during the war.

Ueyama’s landscapes indicate that he, like many Amacheans, circulated within Amache’s 10,000 acres as well as beyond its fences. Some of the barns in Ueyama’s landscapes may be part of the infrastructure of the historic XY Ranch, founded by Fred Harvey in 1889 and utilized for Amache’s agricultural enterprise (fig. 4).[^20] Other structures, as well as some of the river drainages, may be scenes from the town of Granada and its environs. Many Amache residents worked outside the camp, and permits could be obtained to travel further. Similarly, residents of the greater region visited Amache for work, shopping, and social and cultural opportunities. At this time, Amache was the largest “city” in the region, with its own schools, sports leagues, Boy Scout troop, theatrical and musical performances, and art exhibitions, including the 1943 Arts and Crafts Festival in which Ueyama exhibited *The Evacuee* (cat. 19, illustrated above). Camp boundaries were controlled but porous.[^21]

{% figure 'ptl-26162-1-15' 'is-pulled-left' %}

A set of fifteen stones hand-polished by Ueyama while incarcerated reinforces this fact (cat. 42, illustrated nearby). They are not native to the Granada area, which is composed of sand and limestone, yet they found their way to Amache—perhaps picked up in the drainage of the Arkansas River, sent to Ueyama by friends elsewhere, or selected on travels further afield.[^22] While their full stories remain unknown, their existence alludes to circulation beyond camp fences.

Polishing these stones released their humble beauty and may have helped Ueyama endure the passage of time. Earlier, when traveling in Europe, he left a reflective note in his journal:

>> the stone on the road side
>> begins its history of existence
>> only when it is kicked or turned.

Over twenty years later, when polishing these stones, Ueyama provided each a history of existence. The stones beg to be held, turned over, and engaged with. In a quiet way, they signal agency (in the choice of stone and in polishing it) and relationality (by unlocking the inner beauty of each stone and, possibly, through a network of people who may have helped source them). They are a reminder that existence is marked through interaction with others and that nurturing beauty plays a central role in creating and sustaining such interactions.

[^2]: Around 9,000 people voluntarily relocated inland. See ibid., 37 and 41.

[^3]: According to evacuation notices, the belongings they carried had to include bedding and linens, toilet articles, extra clothing, plates and silverware, and essential personal effects. See Robert Y. Fuchigami, *Amache Remembered: An American Concentration Camp, 1942–1945* (Parker, CO: BookCrafters, 2020), 15. On March 1 and April 30, 1942, Ueyama made inventory lists of the couple’s belongings in a small black notebook. The sixty-six boxes plus larger items would remain indefinitely with Mr. and Mrs. Wilson in Los Angeles. See small black notebook, Collection of Bunkado, Inc. I am grateful to Noriko Okada for reviewing the lists, much of which is in Japanese, and confirming their contents.

[^6]: Window shades had to be kept drawn. Trains traveled a variety of routes that usually took about three days and three nights to complete. Stops were short and infrequent, if provided at all. See ibid., 100–03. The first arrivals to Amache on August 27, 1942, were from the Merced Assembly Center. They helped to complete construction on the as-yet-unfinished camp. Eight more trains from Merced arrived between September 3 and 18. Six trains from Santa Anita arrived between September 19 and 30. By the end of September, 7,567 Japanese people had arrived at Granada. See ibid., 104–06.
